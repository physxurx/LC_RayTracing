# LC_RayTracing

This repository contains the main code 
1) for simulating defect lines in liquid crystals using Q-tensor models;
2) for ray tracing in 2d liquid crystal films using Fermat's principle.

> **Note:** Some utility modules (`ults`) are maintained in a separate **private repository** for confidentiality. They are included as a submodule. Access to these requires permission.
